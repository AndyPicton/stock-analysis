# stock-analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a more efficient way to analyze stock data between 2017 and 2018 in Excel using VBA.  

### Background
Steve created an excel file to help his parents invest in stocks in green energy. He needs help analyzing all the data because he is worried his parents are not diversifying their stocks enough. 

## Results
The results show that the 12 stocks I analyzed had a much better year in 2017 than 2018. All but one stock, TERP, had a positive return in 2017 and only two stocks, ENPH & RUN, had a positive return in 2018. In 2017, four stocks had returns over 100% and five over 20%, while 2018 had six over -20% returns. ENPH is the stock to invest in, its reutrn was 129.5% in 2017 and then 81.9% in 2018.

Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
